## Critical Issues That MUST Be Fixed Before Deployment ⚠️

### 1. Google Maps API Keys (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ❌ NOT FIXED - PLACEHOLDER VALUES DETECTED

The following files contain placeholder API keys that MUST be replaced:
- `app.json` (lines 23, 46)
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (line 19)
- `ios/boltexponativewind/AppDelegate.mm` (line 16)

**Action Required**:
1. Get a valid Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Replace all instances of `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key
3. Enable the following APIs in Google Cloud Console:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS
   - Places API (if using location search)

### 2. Firebase Configuration
**Status**: ✅ APPEARS CONFIGURED

Firebase configuration looks complete, but verify:
- All Firebase services are properly enabled in console
- Firestore security rules are production-ready
- Authentication methods are configured

### 3. App Store Configuration
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

Review the following in `app.json`:
- Bundle identifier: `com.benjaminchan.bolt-expo-nativewind`
- App name: `bolt-expo-nativewind` (consider changing to production name)
- Version: `1.0.0`
- Icon and splash screen assets

### 4. Environment Variables
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

Consider using environment variables for:
- API keys
- Firebase configuration
- Other sensitive configuration

### 5. Security Vulnerabilities
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

- ✅ Fixed critical Firebase security vulnerability (updated to 10.14.1)
- ⚠️ Remaining vulnerabilities in geofirestore dependencies (moderate/critical)
  - Consider replacing geofirestore with alternative if not essential
  - Or accept risk if geofirestore features are required

### 6. Performance Optimizations
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

Consider implementing:
- Image optimization and caching
- Bundle size optimization
- Memory leak prevention
- Network request optimization

## Recommended Pre-Deployment Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test on physical devices (iOS and Android)
   - Test offline functionality
   - Test push notifications
   - Test all user flows

2. **Security Review**:
   - Review Firestore security rules
   - Audit API key permissions
   - Check for sensitive data exposure

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with large datasets
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Test network error scenarios

4. **Store Preparation**:
   - Prepare app store listings
   - Create screenshots and descriptions
   - Set up app store connect/play console

## Build Commands

For development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

For production builds:
```bash
# iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Android  
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## Notes

- ESLint is not configured - consider adding for code quality
- All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved
- Error handling has been improved throughout the app
- The app uses Expo SDK 52 which is current as of the fix date
