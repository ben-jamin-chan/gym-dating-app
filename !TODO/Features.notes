* Main Challenges *

Technical Complexity:
Location-based matching requires geospatial indexing and efficient algorithms
Real-time features (messaging, notifications, online status) need reliable infrastructure
High-performance swiping interface must be smooth and responsive
Matching algorithms become complex as you try to improve match quality
Scaling to handle thousands or millions of users and their data

Backend Requirements:
User authentication with secure profile verification
Database design that can handle complex relationships and queries
Storage solutions for photos and media
API development to connect your mobile app with backend services

Other Significant Challenges:
Privacy and security are critical for dating apps (especially location data)
Content moderation to prevent inappropriate content/behavior
Preventing fake profiles and scammers
# Push notification systems that work reliably across devices

For a solo developer or small team:
Start with a simplified version (core features only)
Use existing services (Firebase, AWS Amplify, Supabase) to reduce backend complexity
Focus on one platform initially (iOS or Android)

MVP approach:
Basic profiles and photos ✅
Simple swiping interface ✅
Basic matching
Text-only messaging ✅
Limited geographic scope ✅

# To fix the iOS simulator not being able to connect to the internet.
