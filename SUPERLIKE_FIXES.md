# Super Like & Messaging System Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. **Firebase Offline Errors**: The app frequently goes offline causing "Super Like service temporarily unavailable" errors
2. **"Resetting..." Display**: Shows when `hoursUntilReset` is 0 or negative
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Missing graceful fallbacks for offline scenarios
4. **No User Feedback**: Limited debugging information for users experiencing issues
5. **"Failed to load conversations"**: Messaging system stuck after reconnection due to subscription conflicts
6. **Target ID Conflicts**: "Target ID already exists" errors preventing proper subscription re-establishment

- No offline detection
- Poor fallback handling
- Confusing "Resetting..." display
- Subscription conflicts causing permanent failures

### After:
- Specific error messages for different scenarios
- Automatic offline detection and handling
- Optimistic offline fallbacks
- Clear status indicators ("Ready!" vs "Resetting...")
- User-friendly diagnostic tools
- Automatic subscription conflict resolution
- Comprehensive reconnection handling

## Testing

The diagnostics screen (`/diagnostics`) now includes:
- Super Like status retrieval test
- Network connectivity test
- Cache clearing test
- Manual reset functionality
- Real-time status display
- Conversation refresh test
- Complete app refresh functionality

Access diagnostics through the network banner or navigation, then scroll to "Super Like Diagnostics" section.

## Known Solutions

### Super Like Stuck at "0 Resetting..."
